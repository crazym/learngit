Haha first time trying Git on my PC, gOODluCK yo!
add one line
Ha! try stage concept, insert at 3rd line

GOT SOME DIFF WITH REMOTE DEV BRANCH, WITH IS COMMITED BY ANOTHER REPO
Creating a new branch is quick and simple
switched to a new branch dev, no-ff vs fast forward
already mergered once and noticed that the branch merger didnt appear on log with fast forward
